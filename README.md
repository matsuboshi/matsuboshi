### Hi there! 🤩

My name is Mitsuhiko Takushi (aka Mitch), and I live in Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been learning development because I am passionate about cracking puzzles (🧩), and that's how it feels like when I'm coding (😍). I’m currently learning the <strong>MERN Stack</strong> (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node).

In my free time, I'm into reading (📚), running (🏃‍♂️), yoga (🧘‍♂️), movies (🎞️), cooking (👨‍🍳), dancing (🎵), and more. Above all, tea time (☕) is a must for relaxing and thinking about life.
